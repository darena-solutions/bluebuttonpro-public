# Admin App

The *MeldRx App* is the front door through which a MeldRx instance is configured and administrated.
The app is a web-based tool that allows administrators to manage users, set permissions, and configure settings.

The functionality of the app differs based on which type of user is logged in.

## Permissions Management

## Data Viewer

For convenience, the _MeldRx App_ includes a way to view data that is stored in the _MeldRx Data Vault_.
This is useful for taking a quick glance at what type of data is stored in MeldRx, and is especially useful for non-technical users, such as doctors.
