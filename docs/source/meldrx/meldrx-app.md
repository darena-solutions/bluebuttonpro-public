# MeldRx App

The _MeldRx App_ is the frontend through which a MeldRx instance is configured and administrated.
The app is a web-based tool that allows administrators to manage users, set permissions, and configure settings.

--- NOTE: Depending on who is logged in, the app will be different (patient, provider, admin)

## Data Viewer

For convenience, the _MeldRx App_ includes a way to view data that is stored in the _MeldRx Data Vault_.
This is useful for taking a quick glance at what type of data is stored in MeldRx, and is especially useful for non-technical users, such as doctors.
