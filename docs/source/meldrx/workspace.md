# MeldRx Workspace

The _MeldRx Workspace_ is your comprehensive solution for streamlined healthcare application development.

In the fast-paced landscape of contemporary HealhtIT software development, efficiency, security, and ease of integration are paramount.
Enter the _MeldRx Workspace_, a platform that redefines the development experience by seamlessly integrating a Data Vault, our Identity Management system, a complete FHIR API and so much more, within a singular, developer-centric environment.

Our _Linked Workspace_ is a never-before-seen innovation that allows your apps to connect effortlessly with any EHR or FHIR server, allowing your apps to work in a truly cross-platform way.

## Linked Workspace

Innovation often stems from breaking barriers and defying conventional norms. With that in mind, we proudly introduce a revolutionary new concept - the _Linked Workspace_. This unparalleled innovation allows apps to connect and integrate with any EHR of any type.

Traditionally, development projects required rigid adherence to predefined systems and isolated environments, stifling the potential for true innovation. The Linked Workspace revolutionizes this status quo by granting developers the unprecedented freedom to connect their workspaces to _any_ environment, facilitating data exchange and functionality integratino in ways previously unattainable.

The Linked Workspace doesn't just give access to external EHRs - it enhances them by providing app developers with the tools needed to fill in gaps and deficiencies in the EHR. For example, if an EHR does not allow writing data back, apps can simply write that data to the Workspace and seamlessly _meld_ it back when needed.

The power to bridge external EHR integration and a fully FHIR-compliant internal workspace unlocks a realm of possibilities, from crafting novel applications that blend services in groundbreaking ways, to facilitating rapid experimentation and dynamic adaptations.
