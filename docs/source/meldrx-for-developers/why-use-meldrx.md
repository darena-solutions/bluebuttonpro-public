### SMART-on-FHIR as a Service
We handle all of hte authentication details for you (token exchange, etc.). We provide this as a software service, so it's less code and/or fewer libraries for you to include in your app.

### Configuration Management
Once you configure all of your EHR credentials inside of a Linked App, we provide a simplified way of connecting to those EHR systems. You have fewer configuratino variables to keep track of inside of your application.

### Normalized Requests
Not all EHRs work the same way. Some EHRs require specific information to be included in any requests that are sent to them (e.g. special headers). Some EHRs don't implement the SMART-on-FHIR specification exactly the right way. MeldRx has the ability to detect which EHR you are connecting to, and normalize those requests so they are passed onto the EHR in the correct format. This means that your applciation code can remain clean and avoid branches based on which system you're connecting to.

### Data Storage
Most applications need to keep track of additional pateint data that cannot be written back to the EHR. We provide a built-in Data Vault that allows you to seamlessly work with your own proprietary data needs ass well as with data from the EHR.

### MeldRx Certification
Applications built with MeldRx can become _MeldRx Certified_, indicating that they have been built with the highest level of quality and security in mind.
