# Patient Access

Patients can use MeldRx to view and manage their own clinical data.

## Patient Invite API

The _Patient Invite API_ is an API that is used to invite patients to create accounts on the MeldRx platform.
Typically, a doctor will initiate the _Patient Invite API_ to send an email to the patient inviting them to register on the MeldRx platform. The _MeldRx App_ provides a method for patient invitations to be sent out.

When a patient logs into the MeldRx platform, they have the ability to view their own clinical data.
However, they will not have access to any data on the MeldRx platform that does not pertain to them.

## Multiple Health Systems

If a patient receives care from multiple health organizations, they can manage their clinical data from all organizations using the same MeldRx account. In other words, the patient is _not_ required to make a separate MeldRx account for each health system they go to. Patients can also manage data from other systems, like insurance providers.

## People API

MeldRx has the ability to let users manage patient accounts for multiple patients.
For example, a mother may wish to register with MeldRx as a patient herself, but also register an account for her young children.

The _People API_ provides a means for one patient account to access and manage the health data of another patient.
